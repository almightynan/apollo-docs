## Giveaway Host Commands

### `a!gstart`

> This command is used to start giveaways in a particular channel. The format to use this command is `a!gstart <time> <winners> <prize>`. Once you have entered the parameters, Apollo will automatically delete your message and start a giveaway in that particular channel.\
> \
> For Example to host a giveaway with 2 winners, time of 1 hour and prize of Gold, we type in `a!gstart 1h 2 Gold`

### `a!gend`

> This command is used to end a particular giveaway in a particular channel. If there are more than one giveaways running at the same time then you can use `a!gend <messageid>` to end that particular giveaway, as we replace `<messageid>` with the id of the giveaway.

## Giveaway Control Commands

### `a!gwblacklist`

> This command blacklists a particular user from reacting/participating in giveaways by automatically unreacting to giveaways in the particular server. This command only applies to the local server and not the global giveaway blacklist (i.e. the user can still participate in other giveaways hosted by apollo in other servers)\
> \
> Just type in `a!gwblacklist <@user>` to blacklist them from all giveaways in your server.

### a!gdelete

This command deletes the giveaway log from the a!glist database. To delete a particular giveaway just use the a!gdelete command followed by the giveaway message id that can be obtained either directly from the message or from the [a!glist](giveaways.md#a-glist) command.
