# Configurations

## What is the config command ?

> This command is like the main control for your entire server. Once this command is executed, apollo sends all the configurations set in your server. This command shows your triggers, winner messages and giveaway configurations. It also lets you enable webhook mode which is completely customisable like the webhook avatar and username. In short this command is the **control panel** for your server.

## Sub commands (buttons) for the Config Module

### Triggers

> Pressing this button will show all the trigger messages that will trigger apollo to send a particular win message. Using this menu you can also add or remove the trigger words.&#x20;
